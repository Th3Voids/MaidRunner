#   :: ZYNIX FUSION ::

    zynix-Fusion is a framework that aims to centralize, standardize and simplify the use of various
    security tools for pentest professionals. zynix-Fusion (old name: Linux evil toolkit) has few
    simple commands, one of which is the init function that allows you to define a target, and thus
    use all the tools without typing anything else.

    Zynix is a ruby script made for the purpose of being a shortcut, so instead of creating several
    tools from scratch, it simply uses a range of existing tools.

    Is zynix-Fusion better than setoolkit? Yes and no, there are two that serve the same thing and in a
    different way, the Zynix-Fusion and an automated attack information automation script.

## :: Considerations ::

    ยง 1 About use
    This script was made to automate the steps of gathering information about web targets, the
    misuse and responsibility of the user, to report bugs or make suggestions to open a report on
    github.
    
    ยง 2 About simple_scan
    Automap was replaced by simple_scan, it is lighter and faster, in addition to being less
    detectable, now it has different modes of execution that make it possible from a quick and
    simple execution to more complex modes.
    
    ยง 3 About Console
    The output of the script can be extremely long, so see if your console, (gnome-terminal, cmd,
    konsole) is configured to display 1000 lines (I particularly recommend 10,000 lines), for
    professional purposes it allows the documentation, it records the commands, exits and formats
    the text.
    
##  :: How to work? ::
  
    Zynix works with the idea of providing a personalized (and customizable) command line
    interface, that is, you will have to type internal zynix commands and pass the parameters, but to
    avoid having to pass the same parameter several times there is the function init, which will
    globally store these parameters and use them later in various commands automatically.
    
##  :: How to use it? ::

    There are two types of commands: the internal ones, which are restricted to the back-end
    system and the usable front-end ones that are used to execute the functions.
    red are the functions that do not work at this time or that have been removed.
    
##  :: Installation and configuration ::

    In order to use zynix it is necessary that you have dependencies installed on your computer, at
    the moment there is no script that does this, however it is possible to use it without problems in
    distributions with parrot security, kali linux, back box and fedora security, etc. Soon I will add a
    script to install the dependencies.
    If you use fedora or systems with dnf you can try sudo dnf group install "Security Lab"
    open your terminal in linux and type:
    $ git clone https://github.com/th3void/zynix-fusion.git && cd zynix-fusion && ruby main.rb
    To update the program, enter the main folder and type:
    $ git pull
