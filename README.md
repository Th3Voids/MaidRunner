### Instalation

The project initially includes a set of default files. These files
are created using the best possible data analysis techniques, and
their final versions are merged into the main project.

It consists of two main components: 

* **witch_craft** for CLI application.
* **witch_oracle** for GUI application 

### Build Instructions

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**

cd witch_craft
```

**Step 2: Run the Build Script**
