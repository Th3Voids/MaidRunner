# :: Zynix Fusion :: 

    Zynix fusion is a framework for performing pentest and hacking in web applications, having several renowned tools in its backend, it aims to make it simpler to quickly use several of these tools, also exposing native tools of the project.

## :: A brief history ::

    Zynix Fusion is a project derived from other projects of my own "th3void", and has already had several names, shapes and functions, today it is as I wanted it to be, simple and straightforward.
    In 2015 this was just a shell script for installing some tools on Arch Linux, and it was left aside for many years, but now it is close to what I wanted.

## :: Warnings ::

    This software depends on other software and libraries to work properly, make sure your system has all of them.

## :: Considerations ::

    ยง 1 About use
    This script was made to automate the steps of gathering information about web targets, the
    misuse and responsibility of the user, to report bugs or make suggestions to open a report on
    github.

    ยง 2 About simple_scan
    Automap was replaced by simple_scan, it is lighter and faster, in addition to being less
    detectable, now it has different modes of execution that make it possible from a quick and
    simple execution to more complex modes.

    ยง 3 About Console
    The output of the script can be extremely long, so see if your console, (gnome-terminal, cmd,
    konsole) is configured to display 1000 lines (I particularly recommend 10,000 lines), for
    professional purposes it allows the documentation, it records the commands, exits and formats
    the text.

## :: How to use ::

    There are two types of commands: the internal ones, which are restricted to the back-end
    system and the usable front-end ones that are used to execute the functions.
    red are the functions that do not work at this time or that have been removed.
