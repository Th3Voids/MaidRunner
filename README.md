# Rewriting the whole framework in nim language
 
    This pseudo framework has evolved over time, sometimes for the better, 
    but it's time to do it differently (and this time it works),
    until recently a new version in rust was being created, but rust is very
    complex and brings little productivity in my case, different from the nim
    language, which looks a lot like ruby and python, and compiled and 
    ergonomic.
