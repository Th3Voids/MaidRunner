# Linux evil toolkit && zynix-Fusion

    zynix-Fusion is a framework that aims to centralize, standardize 
    and simplify the use of various security tools for pentest professionals.
    zynix-Fusion (old name: Linux evil toolkit) has few simple commands, one of which is the
    init function that allows you to define a target, and thus use all the tools 
    without typing anything else.

    Is zynix-Fusion better than setoolkit? Yes and no, there are two that serve the
    same thing and in a different way, the Zynix-Fusion and an automated 
    attack information automation script.

    Warning: I am not responsible for the way that this software

    is only educational.

    considerations

    ยง 1 About use

        This script was made to automate the steps of gathering information about web
        targets, the misuse and responsibility of the user, to report bugs or make
        suggestions open a report on github.

    ยง 2 About simple_scan

        Automap was replaced by simple_scan, it is lighter and faster, in addition to being 
        less detectable, now it has different modes of execution that make it possible from
        a quick and simple execution to more complex modes.

    ยง 3 About Console

        The output of the script can be extremely long, so see if your console, 
        (gnome-terminal, cmd, konsole) is configured to display 1000 lines 
        (I particularly recommend 10,000 lines), for professional purposes it allows
        the documentation, it records the commands, exits and formats the text.  

# Basics

## simple_scan options

    alone

        "-sL" --> "List Scan - simply list targets to scan"
        "-sP" --> "Ping Scan - go no further than determining if host is online"

    default

        "-sS -sV" --> "TCP SYN"
        "-sU -sV" --> "UDP Scan"

    icmp_echo

        "-sS -sV -PE" --> "TCP SYN + ICMP echo discovery probes"
        "-sU -sV -PE" --> "UDP Scan + ICMP echo discovery probes"
        "-sA -sV -PE" --> "ACK + ICMP echo discovery probes"

    port_list

        "-sS" --> "TCP SYN + [portlist]: TCP SYN discovery probes to given ports"
        "-sA" --> "ACK + [portlist]: TCP ACK discovery probes to given ports"
        "-sU" --> "UDP Scan + [portlist]: TCP UDP discovery probes to given ports"

    special

        "-sT -sV" --> "Connect()"
        "-sW -sV" --> "Window"
        "-sM -sV" --> "Maimon scans"
        "-sN -sV" --> "TCP Null"
        "-sF -sV" --> "FIN"
