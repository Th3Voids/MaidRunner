### WITCH_CRAFT

  WITCH_CRAFT is a versatile task automation software designed to serve as the
  foundation for various cybersecurity modules. It provides capabilities for tasks
  such as forensic research, OSINT (Open Source Intelligence), scanning, backup and
  copying, intrusion testing of applications and APIs, and more.

### Instalation

The project initially includes a set of default files. These files
are created using the best possible data analysis techniques, and
their final versions are merged into the main project.

### Install using snap

### Plugins

The Witch_Craft project is extensible through static files and Rust code. Moreover, it is possible to extend its functionalities using `db.json`. This file contains a list of small shell scripts, which means you can integrate anything that interacts with the terminal using ARGS (argsv, readargs(), sys.args(), etc).

```json
{
  "description": "Securely deletes and overwrites the contents of a device seven times",
  "name": "nuke.hd",
  "command": "shred -vzn 7 @@device"
}
```

#### This script will run like:

```bash
witchcraft nuke.hd --device /dev/sdx1
```
