## To create a GitHub contribution file with Git-Flow and Rust standards, you can follow these steps:

Create a new Git repository on GitHub for your Rust project.
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/th3maid/MaidRunner
```


## Initialize git-llow in your repository. Git-Flow is a branching model that provides a structure for managing Git branches.
    
```bash
git flow init
```

## Create a new feature branch using Git-Flow for the code changes you want to make.

```bash
git flow feature start my-feature
```

Make the necessary code changes in Rust according to the Rust standards.

## Commit your changes and push the feature branch to the remote repository.

```bash
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin my-feature
```
Once your feature is complete, finish the feature branch and merge it into the 
develop branch using Git-Flow.

```bash
    git flow feature finish my-feature
```

Push the changes to the remote repository.
       
```bash
git push origin develop
```

## Finally, create a pull request on GitHub from the develop branch to the main branch.
    

1. Click on "New pull request" on your repository's GitHub page Choose
2. "develop" as the "base" branch and "master" as the "compare" branch
3. Give your pull request a title and description Click "Create pull request"
